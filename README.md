# PreferenceElicitationAlgorithms

This is our final project for the Algorithmic Economics class. For this project, we created and tested algorithms to estimate a user's preference and offer them the item that would maximize their utility. In this repository, you can find the code we used to create our environments and run the algorithms, a report explaining the motivation and derivation of the algorithms, and a poster summarizing our findings.
